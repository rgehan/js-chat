### Installation

Install all the dependencies through npm (not an npm guru so this might fail)
```
npm install
```

### Development
Just run ``` npm run dev ``` to launch the development server, hot-reload plugin, and all the great stuff Webpack allows.

### Build
Webpack allows you to compile all the JS files to ``` /dist/build.js ``` with the command:
```
npm run build
```
